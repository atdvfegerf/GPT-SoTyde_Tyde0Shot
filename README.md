### The Tyde0Shot colab will be out soon (for covers) along with its guide and local version



## Guide Colab
- Run "Clone and Install" and wait a few minutes, when a green check appears, it was successful
- Run "Run" and when appears 2 link blue, prizes the second link "public link"
- after opening the public link, follow [this guide](https://github.com/atdvfegerf/GPT-SoTyde_Tyde0Shot/blob/main/README.md#huggingfaceco-and-colab-gradio-guide)

  ## Huggingface.co and Colab gradio guide
  - in "the text to be said" put your text
  - in "URL of the zip file with the dataset on hf.co (10 seconds is fine)!" put your link zip that you uploaded to hugginface, with your dataset inside, mp3,mp4,flac,wav
  - in "Language" you can select the language of the text written before, or the language you want your character to speak
  - now press submit and wait a few seconds, usually with a text about 40 characters long it takes 7/10 seconds in colab, 15/17/20 seconds in huggingface.co
  - now your audio will have appeared in "output" which you can either listen to from gradio or install with the arrow
